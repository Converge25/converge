Okay, here's a breakdown of commands and instructions you can adapt to tell an AI agent how to automate the important features of your Shopify app:I. Project Setup and Development WorkflowInitialize Project: "Set up a new Shopify app project using the Shopify CLI."Version Control: "Initialize a Git repository for the project and connect it to GitHub."CI/CD Pipeline: "Create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.On every code push: Run all tests.If tests pass: Deploy the app to a staging environment.On tagged commits: Deploy the app to the production environment."Automated Testing: "Implement automated tests.Write unit tests for all functions and components.Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the app.Write end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions in a browser."II. In-App Automation (Shopify)Abandoned Cart Reminders: "Automate abandoned cart reminders.Listen for the checkouts/create webhook from Shopify.Store checkout data in the database.Create a background job that runs after 1 hour:Check for abandoned checkouts.For each abandoned checkout:Create a discount code using the Shopify API.Send an abandoned cart email with a link and the discount code using SendGrid.Listen for the checkouts/update webhook.Update the checkout status in the database when a checkout is completed."Order Confirmations: "Automate order confirmations.Listen for the orders/create webhook from Shopify.Send an order confirmation email using SendGrid immediately after receiving the webhook.Include order details (order number, items, shipping address, total cost) in the email."Welcome Emails: "Automate welcome emails.When a customer creates an account or subscribes:Send a welcome email using SendGrid.Personalize the email with the customer's name.Include a call to action to explore the store."Product data sync: "Create a background job to sync product data (name, price, inventory) from an external system to Shopify using the Shopify API every 24 hours."III. General InstructionsError Handling: "Implement robust error handling for all automated processes. Log errors and implement retry mechanisms where appropriate."Scalability: "Ensure all automated processes are designed to handle a growing number of users and data."Security: "Follow security best practices when implementing automation, including secure storage of API keys and protection against vulnerabilities."Monitoring: "Implement monitoring to track the performance of all automated processes and alert for any issues."Logging: "Implement detailed logging to track the execution of automated tasks for debugging and auditing."Key Points to Emphasize to the Agent:Webhooks are essential: Make sure the agent understands that Shopify uses webhooks to notify the app of events.Use Shopify API: The agent should use the Shopify API to interact with the merchant's store.Background jobs for async tasks: The agent should use background jobs for tasks that don't need to happen immediately.Testing is critical: All automated features must be thoroughly tested.
